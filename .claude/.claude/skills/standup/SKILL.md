# Standup Skill

Read Claude-generated standups from the assistant pipeline.

> **Related Skills:**
> - `meetings` - Raw meeting transcripts (standups are extracted summaries)
> - `jobs` - Task management for the same 4 jobs
> - `workflow` - Trigger sync to generate new standups
> - `sync-control` - Check why standup might be missing
> - `debrief` - Forward-looking daily briefings (vs standups = backward-looking)

## Prerequisites

Always pull latest data first:

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
```

---

## Read Latest Standup for Job

```bash
JOB="amazon"  # amazon, experian, britannica, cvs
head -80 ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/standups/$JOB/standup.md
```

---

## Read Standup for Specific Date

```bash
JOB="amazon"
DATE="2025-12-29"

# Extract the section for that date
awk "/^## $DATE/,/^---$/" ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/standups/$JOB/standup.md
```

---

## List All Jobs with Standups

```bash
ls ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/standups/
```

---

## Get Accomplishments Only

```bash
JOB="amazon"
DATE="2025-12-29"

awk "/^## $DATE/,/^### Today/" ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/standups/$JOB/standup.md | \
  grep -A 100 "^### Yesterday" | grep "^-"
```

---

## Get Blockers Only

```bash
JOB="amazon"
DATE="2025-12-29"

awk "/^## $DATE/,/^### Notes|^### Meetings/" ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/standups/$JOB/standup.md | \
  grep -A 100 "^### Blockers" | grep "^-"
```

## Common Workflows

### "What did I accomplish at Amazon yesterday?"

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
YESTERDAY=$(date -v-1d +%Y-%m-%d)
awk "/^## $YESTERDAY/,/^---$/" standups/amazon/standup.md
```

### "Any blockers for CVS?"

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
head -80 standups/cvs/standup.md | grep -A 10 "### Blockers"
```

### "Show me all standups from this week"

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
for job in amazon experian britannica cvs; do
  echo "=== $job ==="
  head -50 standups/$job/standup.md
  echo ""
done
```

### "What meetings did I have for Experian today?"

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
awk "/^## $TODAY/,/^---$/" standups/experian/standup.md | grep -A 20 "### Meetings"
```

### "I want the raw meeting transcript, not the summary"

Use the `meetings` skill instead:
```bash
grep -rl -E "(experian|credit)" ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/meetings/ --include="*.md"
```

## No Standup for Expected Date?

1. **Check if workflow ran** (use `workflow` skill):
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=daily-sync.yml -R Sohailm25/assistant --limit=3
   ```

2. **Check if meetings were classified for that job:**
   - Standups only generate if meetings were classified to that job
   - Check workflow logs for classification output

3. **Check sync state** (use `sync-control` skill):
   ```bash
   cat ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/data/sync-state.json | jq
   ```

4. **Force regenerate:**
   - Reset sync state and trigger workflow (see `sync-control` and `workflow` skills)
   ```bash
   # Reset state, then:
   gh workflow run daily-sync.yml -R Sohailm25/assistant
   ```
