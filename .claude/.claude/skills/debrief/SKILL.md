# Debrief Skill

Read daily briefings generated by the assistant pipeline.

> **Related Skills:**
> - `standup` - Backward-looking (what was accomplished) vs debrief = forward-looking (what's coming)
> - `jobs` - Task management and Linear issue lists
> - `workflow` - Trigger sync to generate new debriefs
> - `sync-control` - Check why debrief might be missing

## Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Debrief Directory | `~/Repos/experiments/assistant/debrief/` |
| File Pattern | `debrief/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Generated By | `src/processing/debrief.py` |
| Timing | Generated for *tomorrow* at each sync |

---

## Prerequisites

Always pull latest data first:

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
```

---

## Read Tomorrow's Debrief

```bash
TOMORROW=$(date -v+1d +%Y-%m-%d)
cat ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/debrief/$TOMORROW.md
```

---

## Read Today's Debrief

```bash
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
cat ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/debrief/$TODAY.md
```

---

## Read Debrief for Specific Date

```bash
DATE="2025-12-30"
cat ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/debrief/$DATE.md
```

---

## List Recent Debriefs

```bash
ls -la ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/debrief/ | tail -10
```

---

## List All Available Debriefs

```bash
ls ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/debrief/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort
```

---

## Common Workflows

### "What's on my plate tomorrow?"

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
TOMORROW=$(date -v+1d +%Y-%m-%d)
cat debrief/$TOMORROW.md
```

### "Show me this week's debriefs"

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6; do
  DATE=$(date -v+${i}d +%Y-%m-%d)
  if [ -f "debrief/$DATE.md" ]; then
    echo "=== $DATE ==="
    head -30 debrief/$DATE.md
    echo ""
  fi
done
```

### "Compare today vs yesterday's priorities"

```bash
cd ~/Repos/experiments/assistant && git pull --ff-only
echo "=== Yesterday ==="
cat debrief/$(date -v-1d +%Y-%m-%d).md 2>/dev/null || echo "No debrief"
echo ""
echo "=== Today ==="
cat debrief/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md 2>/dev/null || echo "No debrief"
```

### "What did I accomplish yesterday?" (wrong skill)

Use the `standup` skill instead - debriefs are forward-looking, standups are backward-looking:
```bash
head -80 ~/Repos/experiments/assistant/standups/amazon/standup.md
```

### "What tasks do I have for Amazon?" (wrong skill)

Use the `jobs` skill for live Linear data:
```bash
# See jobs skill for Linear query
```

---

## No Debrief for Expected Date?

1. **Debriefs are generated for TOMORROW**
   - The 10PM sync generates tomorrow's debrief
   - If it's Monday morning, check for Monday's date, not Sunday's

2. **Check if workflow ran** (use `workflow` skill):
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=daily-sync.yml -R Sohailm25/assistant --limit=3
   ```

3. **Check workflow logs:**
   ```bash
   gh run view <RUN_ID> -R Sohailm25/assistant --log 2>/dev/null | grep -i debrief
   ```

4. **Force regenerate** (use `workflow` skill):
   ```bash
   gh workflow run daily-sync.yml -R Sohailm25/assistant
   ```

## Debrief Generation Logic

The debrief generator (`src/processing/debrief.py`) creates briefings by:

1. Scanning recent action items across all jobs
2. Checking Linear for open issues
3. Looking at upcoming due dates
4. Summarizing yesterday's meetings
5. Prioritizing tasks for the coming day

The output is a markdown file with sections for priorities, meetings, and action items.
